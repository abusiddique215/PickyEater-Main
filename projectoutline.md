I'd like to make an iOS food preference app called **PickyEater**. The app will do these things:

1. **Use a free API** that provides real-time data on restaurants, menus, prices, and crowd estimates, similar to Uber Eats or DoorDash.

2. **Allow users to input their dietary preferences or cravings** through an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

3. **Show a list of nearby restaurants or food outlets** that match the user's selected options.

4. **Remember the user's dietary preferences** each time the app is opened, providing a seamless experience.

5. **Display detailed information** for each restaurant, including menu items, prices, and estimated crowd levels.

6. **Include embedded links (preferably affiliate links)** to the menu item or restaurant page on the actual Uber Eats or DoorDash website, allowing users to directly access ordering options.

7. **Allow users to update or modify their preferences** at any time within the app.

8. **Design the interface** using modern iOS design principles with SwiftUI, ensuring a clean, responsive, and engaging user experience.

9. **Support accessibility features**, like Dynamic Type, to accommodate different font sizes and improve usability for all users.

10. **Securely store user preferences** on the device, ensuring data privacy and security.
