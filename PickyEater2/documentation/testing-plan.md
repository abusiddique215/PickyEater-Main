## Overview

The testing plan ensures that **PickyEater** functions correctly, meets user requirements, and provides a high-quality experience.

---

## Testing Strategy

- **Shift-Left Testing**: Test early and often in the development lifecycle.
- **Automation**: Automate tests where possible to improve efficiency.

---

## Unit Testing

### Scope

- Test individual units of code, like functions and methods.

### Focus Areas

- ViewModels
- Utility functions
- Data parsing and validation

### Example

```swift
import XCTest
@testable import PickyEater

class RestaurantServiceTests: XCTestCase {
func testFetchRestaurantsSuccess() {
let service = RestaurantService()
// Mock API response and assert results
}
}
```

---

## Integration Testing

### Scope

- Test interactions between different modules.

### Focus Areas

- API communication
- Data persistence
- Authentication flows

---

## UI Testing

### Scope

- Test the user interface components and user interactions.

### Focus Areas

- Navigation
- Input handling
- Accessibility features

### Example

```swift
import XCTest

class PickyEaterUITests: XCTestCase {
func testLoginFlow() {
let app = XCUIApplication()
app.launch()

app.buttons["LoginButton"].tap()
// Verify the login screen appears
}
}
```

---

## End-to-End Testing

### Scope

- Test complete user scenarios from start to finish.

### Focus Areas

- User onboarding
- Restaurant search and selection
- Subscription purchase flow

---

## Manual Testing

- **Exploratory Testing**: Identify usability issues and edge cases.
- **Regression Testing**: Verify that new changes have not broken existing functionality.

---

## Continuous Integration

- Integrate testing into the CI pipeline.
- Fail builds when critical tests fail.

---

## Test Data Management

- Use mock data for unit and integration tests.
- Ensure sensitive data is not exposed.

---

## Tools and Frameworks

- **XCTest**: For unit and UI tests.
- **Simulators**: Test on various simulated devices.
- **Mocking Frameworks**: Like **Cuckoo** or **MockFive** for dependency mocking.

---

## Conclusion

A thorough testing plan enhances app reliability and user satisfaction. Regular testing helps catch issues early and reduces maintenance costs.
