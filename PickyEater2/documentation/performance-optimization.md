## Overview

This document outlines strategies to optimize the performance of **PickyEater**, ensuring a smooth user experience and efficient resource utilization.

---

## Frontend Performance

### Lazy Loading

- Utilize `LazyVStack` and `LazyHStack` to efficiently render long lists.

```swift
ScrollView {
LazyVStack {
ForEach(restaurants) { restaurant in
RestaurantRowView(restaurant: restaurant)
}
}
}
```

### View Updates

- Minimize re-renders by carefully managing `@State` and `@Published` properties.
- Use **Equatable** views when possible.

### Asynchronous Operations

- Perform heavy computations or operations off the main thread using `DispatchQueue.global()`.

### Avoiding Overdraw

- Optimize the use of modifiers and layers to prevent unnecessary rendering.

---

## Network Performance

### Caching

- Implement response caching for API calls to reduce network usage.

### Request Throttling

- Limit the frequency of network requests when users perform rapid actions.

### Efficient Data Fetching

- Request only necessary data fields from APIs.

### Compression

- Enable data compression when sending and receiving data.

---

## Image Handling

### Use of Kingfisher

- Kingfisher provides efficient image caching and asynchronous loading.

### Image Size Optimization

- Fetch appropriately sized images to reduce memory usage.

---

## Memory Management

### ARC Practices

- Ensure proper use of weak references to avoid retain cycles.

### Resource Cleanup

- Cancel network requests when they are no longer needed.
- Dispose of subscriptions in Combine when appropriate.

---

## Best Practices

- **Profile Regularly**

- Use Xcode Instruments to identify and fix performance bottlenecks.

- **Optimize Launch Time**

- Defer non-critical tasks during app startup.

- **Reduce App Footprint**

- Remove unused assets and code.

---

## Monitoring and Profiling

- **Instruments Tools**

- Time Profiler
- Memory Leaks
- Allocation

- **FPS Monitoring**

- Keep an eye on frames per second to ensure smooth animations.

---

## Conclusion

Applying these performance optimization techniques will help **PickyEater** run efficiently, offering users a responsive and enjoyable experience.
