## Overview

Although **PickyEater** is primarily an iOS app without a custom backend, adopting DevOps practices ensures efficient development cycles, automated testing, and smooth deployment processes. This document outlines the strategies for continuous integration, continuous deployment, and overall DevOps practices for the project.

---

## Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

### Tools and Platforms

- **GitHub Actions**: For automating build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Fastlane**: For automating beta deployments, code signing, and app store submissions.

### CI/CD Pipeline Steps

1. **Code Checkout**

- Pull the latest code from the Git repository upon commit or pull request.

2. **Dependency Installation**

- Resolve Swift Package Manager dependencies.

3. **Code Signing**

- Manage certificates and provisioning profiles securely.

4. **Build**

- Compile the app using the appropriate Xcode version.

5. **Testing**

- Run unit tests and UI tests to ensure code quality.

6. **Beta Distribution**

- Use **TestFlight** to distribute beta builds to testers.

7. **App Store Deployment**

- Automate the submission of the app to the App Store for review.

### Sample GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
push:
branches: [main]
pull_request:
branches: [main]

jobs:
build-and-test:
name: Build and Test
runs-on: macOS-latest
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
- name: Set up Xcode
uses: maxim-lobanov/setup-xcode@v1
with:
xcode-version: '13.4'
- name: Resolve Dependencies
run: xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies
- name: Build
run: xcodebuild -scheme PickyEater2 -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 13' build
- name: Run Tests
run: xcodebuild test -scheme PickyEater2 -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 13'

deploy:
name: Deploy to TestFlight
needs: build-and-test
if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && success()
runs-on: macOS-latest
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
- name: Install Fastlane
run: gem install fastlane
- name: Set up Fastlane Session
env:
FASTLANE_SESSION: ${{ secrets.APPLE_SESSION }}
run: echo "Session set"
- name: Build and Deploy
run: fastlane ios beta
env:
APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY }}
MATCH_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.MATCH_PASSWORD }}
```

**Note:** Ensure sensitive data like certificates and passwords are securely stored in GitHub Secrets.

---

## Version Control

### Git Workflow

- **Main Branch**: Production-ready code.
- **Develop Branch**: Integration branch for features and fixes.
- **Feature Branches**: Short-lived branches for new features.

### Commit Strategy

- **Atomic Commits**: Small, focused commits with clear messages.
- **Conventional Commits**: Follow a standard like:

```
feat: Add new spin wheel feature
fix: Resolve crash when fetching restaurants
docs: Update README with setup instructions
```

---

## Build Automation

- Use **Fastlane** to automate:

- Incrementing build numbers.
- Managing provisioning profiles.
- Signing builds.

- **Lane Example:**

```ruby
lane :beta do
increment_build_number
build_app(scheme: "PickyEater2")
upload_to_testflight
end
```

---

## Testing Automation

- Integrate test execution in the CI pipeline.
- Ensure tests cover critical functionalities before deployment.

---

## Deployment Strategy

### Beta Testing

- **TestFlight**: For distributing beta builds to internal and external testers.
- **Feedback Collection**: Use built-in TestFlight features to collect user feedback.

### App Store Release

- **Manual Review**: Ensure all App Store guidelines are met before submission.
- **Phased Release**: Optionally release updates gradually.

---

## Monitoring and Logging

### Crash Reporting

- **Firebase Crashlytics**: Monitor app crashes and non-fatal errors.

### Analytics

- **Firebase Analytics**: Track user engagement and app usage patterns.

### Log Management

- Implement logging for critical operations, ensuring logs are anonymized and comply with privacy policies.

---

## Security Considerations

- **Sensitive Data Handling**

- Store API keys and secrets securely.
- Do not commit sensitive information to the repository.

- **Certificate Management**

- Use encrypted repositories or services (e.g., **match** from Fastlane) for managing certificates.

- **Dependency Updates**

- Regularly update third-party libraries to incorporate security patches.

---

## Backup and Recovery

- **Source Code**

- Ensure the Git repository is backed up and accessible.

- **Configuration Data**

- Backup configurations like Fastlane and provisioning profiles.

- **Disaster Recovery Plan**

- Outline steps to recover from data loss or critical failures.

---

## Conclusion

Implementing robust DevOps practices ensures that **PickyEater** is developed efficiently, tested thoroughly, and deployed reliably. Automation reduces errors and accelerates the development lifecycle, leading to a more stable and secure application.
