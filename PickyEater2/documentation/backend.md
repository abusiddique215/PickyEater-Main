## Overview

**PickyEater** operates without a custom backend server. Instead, it integrates with third-party APIs for restaurant data and manages user data locally on the device. Authentication and subscription management are handled using Apple's services and third-party SDKs.

---

## Third-Party API Integration

### Yelp Fusion API

- **Purpose:** Fetches real-time restaurant data.

- **Integration:**

- Use **Alamofire** for network requests.
- Store the API key securely (e.g., in the Keychain or encrypted plist).

- **Endpoints:**

- Search Businesses (`/businesses/search`)
- Business Details (`/businesses/{id}`)

- **Request Handling:**

- Build requests with necessary parameters (location, preferences).
- Handle responses using Codable models.

- **Error Handling:**

- Process HTTP error codes.
- Implement retries with backoff strategy if necessary.

---

## Local Data Storage

### User Preferences

- **Storage:** Use `UserDefaults` for basic preferences, `Keychain` for sensitive data.

- **Data Managed:**

- Dietary preferences.
- Favorite cuisines.
- Subscription status.

- **Implementation:**

- Create a `PreferencesManager` singleton for managing preferences.

### Subscription Receipts

- **Storage:** Store receipts securely in the Keychain.

- **Verification:**

- Use on-device receipt verification.
- Optionally implement server-side verification for enhanced security.

## Authentication and Subscription Management

### Sign in with Apple

- **Framework:** `AuthenticationServices`

- **Flow:**

- Handle authorization requests and responses.
- Manage user identification securely.

### Social Logins (Facebook and Google)

- **Facebook SDK:**

- Configure the app with Facebook App ID.
- Implement login button and handle access tokens.

- **Google Sign-In SDK:**

- Configure with client ID.
- Handle authentication callbacks.

### Subscription Management

- **Framework:** `StoreKit` or **RevenueCat** SDK.

- **Implementation:**

- Set up products in App Store Connect.
- Handle purchase flow and transaction updates.
- Manage subscription status within the app.

---

## Error Logging and Monitoring

- **Crash Reporting:**

- Optionally integrate with services like Firebase Crashlytics.

- **Logging:**

- Implement logs for critical operations.
- Ensure sensitive data is not logged.

---

## Security and Compliance

- **Data Protection:**

- Use Keychain for sensitive data.
- Encrypt data where applicable.

- **Privacy Policies:**

- Provide clear privacy policy and terms of service.

- **Regulatory Compliance:**

- Adhere to GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant regulations.

## Conclusion

While **PickyEater** doesn't have a traditional backend, careful management of third-party integrations and local data storage is crucial. This documentation provides guidance to ensure secure and effective backend operations within the app.
