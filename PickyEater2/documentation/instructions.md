   - Refer to **User Flow Documentation** for user interaction guidelines and primary user journeys.

2. **Design:**
   - Follow **Frontend Documentation** for UI/UX standards and SwiftUI implementation.
   - Utilize **State Management Documentation** for managing app state effectively using SwiftUI and Combine.

3. **Implementation:**
   - Adhere to **Backend Documentation** for API integrations, data handling, and authentication.
   - Incorporate external tools and libraries as outlined in **Third-Party Libraries Documentation**.
   - Implement features according to the detailed plans in each documentation file.

4. **Testing:**
   - Develop tests as per the **Testing Plan** to ensure code quality and functionality.
   - Use **Code Documentation** guidelines to write maintainable and well-documented code.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Follow **DevOps Documentation** for setting up CI/CD pipelines, managing version control, and deploying builds.
   - Use **DevOps Documentation** to automate beta distributions and App Store submissions.

## AI Assistant Usage

When interacting with you, **Claude Sonnet 3.5**, follow these guidelines to ensure efficient and accurate assistance:

1. **Refer to Specific Documentation:**
   - **Example:** If assistance is needed with user authentication, refer to `docs/backend.md` under the "Authentication and Subscription Management" section.

2. **Structured Queries:**
   - Ask clear and concise questions related to specific components or issues.
   - Specify the relevant documentation reference if known to guide effective solutions.

3. **Continuous Reference:**
   - Continuously read and reference all documentation files in the `docs/` directory to inform responses and solutions.

4. **Sequential Assistance:**
   - Address one component or issue at a time, ensuring thorough and detailed assistance before moving to the next.

## Best Practices

- **Consistency:** Maintain uniform coding styles, naming conventions, and documentation standards across the project.

- **Security:** Prioritize data privacy and secure handling of user information, especially when dealing with authentication and preferences.

- **Efficiency:** Optimize performance by following outlined optimization strategies in the documentation.

- **Accessibility:** Ensure the app is accessible to all users by implementing recommended accessibility features such as Dynamic Type and VoiceOver compatibility.

- **Documentation Maintenance:** Keep all documentation up-to-date with any changes or new features added to the app.

## Troubleshooting

- **Common Issues:** Refer to specific sections in the documentation based on the problem area.
  - **Authentication Problems:** `docs/backend.md` under "Authentication and Subscription Management".
  - **API Integration Errors:** `docs/api.md`.
  - **UI Rendering Issues:** `docs/frontend.md`.

- **Error Messages:** Use **Error Handling Documentation** in both `docs/frontend.md` and `docs/backend.md` to interpret and resolve error messages.

- **Performance Bottlenecks:** Utilize strategies outlined in `docs/performance-optimization.md` to identify and fix performance issues.
